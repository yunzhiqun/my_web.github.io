现在我需要你按照一篇英文介绍仿写一篇，英文我会放在末尾.
先说要求，要求如下，大学修改为University of Wyoming这个大学，然后研究方向修改为CO2 capture and utilization，并不是简单的替换词汇，需要你先去查询University of Wyoming这个大学和这个大学的capture and utilization专业，了解情况后根据修改后的大学和专业的具体情况来调整内容进行仿写。格式要求如下，请在第一段用英文，写上你仿写的内容，要求无语病和逻辑错误；在第二段用中文书写，格式为括号加数字，列出你查询到并且添加到仿写内容的大学和专业的情况。
英文介绍如下：The university I chose is the University of Wyoming in America. It is a famous state research university in the USA. It is also very famous in the field of chemical engineering, which has ranked top 100 around the world. The supervisor I chose is Prof. Adidharma. Prof. Adidharma is an expert on chemical engineering and is experienced in CO2 capture and utilization. Prof. Adidharma has published many journal papers in CO2 capture and utilization. He has rich experience both in theory and practice. The research field he focuses on is quite relevant with mine. Therefore, both advanced laboratory equipment and skilled supervisor can guarantee my study at UW.The UW has constructed a large variety of highquality facilities on campus for R&D projects in the areas of fossil fuel energy production and its associated environmental issues. This is due in large part to the abundance of fossil fuel resources in Wyoming and the University’s commitment to the development of clean fossil energy for the nation. This has led to extensive experience in providing facility and logistical as well as technical support for diverse energy and environmental projects. The experimental facilities needed for performing all the planned tasks will be provided by UW's School of Energy Resources, and the Departments of Chemical & Petroleum Engineering and Chemistry. In addition, if necessary, the laboratory spaces in other departments at UW are also available for the proposed project. The machine shops, electronic shop, and instrument labs at UW can be accessed by the research team of the proposed project. Many research groups at UW are specialized in research and development activities with expertise in energy production, waste management and environmental quality control, and new material development technologies. These groups have long histories of energy production from coal, shale, and tight sands. If needed, their facilities could also be used for the proposed project. UW continues to build facilities for utilization of new energy resour。
